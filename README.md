Dart Programming Repository
Welcome to the Dart Programming Repository, a comprehensive collection of examples, concepts, and projects to master the Dart programming language.

üü° About Dart
Dart is a modern, object-oriented, and client-optimized programming language developed by Google. It is widely used for building high-performance applications, especially with Flutter for cross-platform app development. 
Dart‚Äôs features include:
Strong Typing: Static and dynamic typing for flexibility and safety.
Asynchronous Programming: Built-in support for Futures, Streams, and async/await.
Null Safety: Eliminates null reference errors at compile time.
High Performance: Compiles to native machine code for better speed.
Scalability: Ideal for both small scripts and large, scalable projects.

üõ† Purpose
This repository is designed to:
Serve as a learning resource for beginners and intermediate developers exploring Dart.
Provide practical code examples for mastering core and advanced concepts.
Showcase mini projects demonstrating real-world use cases of Dart.
